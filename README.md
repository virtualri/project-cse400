# Project Repository 

> CSE-400

> This repository and contents are under development and update accordingly

## **Project Title**

**Sponsor based resource allocation using artificial feed-forward based neural network**

> Project title may change at the moment of final compile & with the advice of the supervisor


## Software development model

## Project Schedule

On-going from Wed Apr 17 2019 while the schedule under development and will publish within **week 38**


## Literacy and understanding under discussion and supervisor

### System view: Logitcal and J2EE distributed multitier architecture 

#### Multitier: logical view

### Optimization and Selecting Employee as SPONSORING the client 

#### Process A: Finding the model using tpot
![Genetic algorithm](/images/geneticAlgorithm.png)


#### Process B: Tpot is a technology as tool
![TPOT: Automated to finding the model and predict the output](/images/tpot.png)



### Resource ( room and employee) allocation

> Developing in JAVA EE, jscript, jsp, MySql Community Server, Apache Tomcat Server, github and project management and bug reporting tools
